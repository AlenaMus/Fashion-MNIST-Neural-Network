    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **fully connected neural network** to classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Fashion MNIST?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion MNIST is a dataset of clothing images created by Zalando as a modern replacement for the classic MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **60,000 training images**\n",
    "- **10,000 test images**\n",
    "- **28×28 pixel grayscale images** (single channel)\n",
    "- **10 clothing categories**: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a **Dense (Fully Connected) Neural Network** with the following architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (784) → Dense(512, ReLU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(256, ReLU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(10, Softmax)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture\n",
    "- ReLU activation for hidden layers\n",
    "- Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- Softmax output for multi-class classification\n",
    "- Adam optimizer with Categorical Crossentropy loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Performance:** 85-90% accuracy on test set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Environment setup and GPU configuration\n",
    "2. Data loading and exploration\n",

    "## Section 7: Neural Network Architecture - Design & Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "We use a **Fully Connected (Dense) Neural Network** with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (784) → Dense(512, ReLU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(256, ReLU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(10, Softmax)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Fully Connected (Dense) Layers?\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: Dense networks are straightforward to understand and implement, making them ideal for learning fundamental neural network concepts\n",
    "2. **Fashion MNIST characteristics**: The images are small (28×28), grayscale, and centered - dense layers can effectively learn patterns from these simple images\n",
    "3. **Sufficient performance**: Dense networks achieve 85-90% accuracy on Fashion MNIST, meeting our target\n",
    "4. **Educational value**: Understanding dense networks is the foundation before moving to more complex architectures like CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why NOT Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?\n",
    "While CNNs would achieve slightly higher accuracy (~92-95%) by preserving spatial relationships, our goal is to demonstrate core neural network concepts. Dense layers process all pixels equally, which is sufficient for this small, centered dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer-by-Layer Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Layer | Output Shape | Parameters | Purpose |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|------------|----------|\n",

    "| Dense 1 | (512,) | 401,920 | Learn low-level patterns (edges, textures) |\n",
    "| Dropout 1 | (512,) | 0 | Prevent overfitting (drop 20% of neurons) |\n",
    "| Dense 2 | (256,) | 131,328 | Combine patterns into higher-level features |\n",
    "| Dropout 2 | (256,) | 0 | Additional overfitting prevention |\n",
    "| Output | (10,) | 2,570 | Probability for each clothing class |\n",

    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** for hidden layers: f(x) = max(0, x)\n",
    "  - Solves the vanishing gradient problem (unlike sigmoid/tanh)\n",
    "  - Computationally efficient\n",
    "  - Introduces non-linearity so the network can learn complex patterns\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Softmax** for output layer: converts raw scores to probabilities that sum to 1.0\n",
    "  - Each of the 10 outputs represents the probability of that clothing class\n",
    "  - The class with the highest probability is the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Regularization\n",
    "- Randomly disables 20% of neurons during each training step\n",
    "- Forces the network to not rely on any single neuron\n",
    "- Improves generalization to unseen data (reduces overfitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron Count Rationale (512 → 256 → 10)\n",
    "- **Decreasing width** creates a \"funnel\" that compresses information\n",
    "- **512 neurons** in the first layer capture many low-level features from 784 inputs\n",
    "- **256 neurons** in the second layer combine these into fewer, more meaningful features\n",
    "- **10 neurons** in the output produce one score per clothing class"

    "## Section 8: Loss Function & Optimizer Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Measures how different the predicted probability distribution is from the true label. It penalizes the model more when it is confidently wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** Loss = -Σ(y_true × log(y_pred))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why chosen:**\n",
    "1. **Multi-class classification**: Fashion MNIST has 10 mutually exclusive classes - Categorical Crossentropy is the standard loss for this type of problem\n",
    "2. **One-hot encoded labels**: Our labels are in one-hot format `[0,0,0,1,0,...]` which matches this loss function's expected input\n",
    "3. **Softmax pairing**: Mathematically pairs with softmax activation, providing clean gradients for efficient backpropagation\n",
    "4. **Penalizes confidence errors**: A prediction of 0.01 for the correct class is penalized much more than 0.4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative considered:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy - works with integer labels (0-9) instead of one-hot encoded. Functionally identical but we chose Categorical since we already one-hot encoded our labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** An advanced optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of two other optimizers - AdaGrad (adapts learning rate per parameter) and RMSProp (uses moving average of squared gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why chosen:**\n",
    "1. **Adaptive learning rates**: Automatically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually - parameters that update frequently get smaller rates, rare parameters get larger rates\n",
    "2. **Fast convergence**: Typically requires fewer epochs than basic SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)\n",
    "3. **Minimal tuning**: Works excellently with the default learning rate of 0.001\n",
    "4. **Momentum**: Uses exponential moving averages of gradients, which helps escape local minima and smooths the optimization path\n",
    "5. **Industry standard**: The most widely used optimizer in modern deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives considered:**\n",
    "- **SGD**: Simpler but requires careful learning rate tuning and more epochs\n",
    "- **RMSProp**: Good but Adam generally performs better by adding momentum\n",
    "- **AdaGrad**: Learning rate can decay too aggressively over time"

    "\n",
    "Now let's use our trained model to classify **your own clothing images**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Function Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `predict_clothing_image()` function takes any external image file and:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads the image** from the file path\n",
    "2. **Converts to grayscale** (if it's a color image)\n",
    "3. **Resizes to 28×28 pixels** (Fashion MNIST format)\n",
    "4. **Auto-inverts colors if needed** — Fashion MNIST has light clothing on dark backgrounds, but real photos are the opposite. The function detects this and inverts automatically.\n",
    "5. **Normalizes pixel values** to [0, 1] (divide by 255)\n",
    "6. **Flattens to 784-element vector** (same as training data)\n",
    "7. **Feeds through the neural network**\n",
    "8. **Returns the predicted class and confidence**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Inversion — Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion MNIST images look like this: **black background, light-colored clothing silhouette**. Real-world photos are the opposite: **light/white background, dark clothing**. Without inverting, the model gets completely different input than what it was trained on, causing poor predictions. The function handles this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Format Requirements:**\n",
    "- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP\n",
    "- Any size image works (auto-resized to 28×28)\n",
    "- Color or grayscale images both work (auto-converted)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1 — File Upload Widget** (recommended for Jupyter):\n",
    "Run the upload widget cell below, click \"Upload\", select your clothing image, and get an instant prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2 — Manual Path Input**:\n",
    "When prompted, type or paste the full path to your clothing image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The function displays:\n",
    "- **Left plot**: Original image as loaded\n",
    "- **Center plot**: The preprocessed 28×28 grayscale image (what the model sees)\n",
    "- **Right plot**: Confidence bar chart for all 10 classes\n",

    "## Section 14: Save Trained Model (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "After spending time training our model, we want to **save it for future use** without needing to retrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Saved\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.keras` file format (TensorFlow 2.x) saves the **complete model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Architecture** - layer structure, neuron counts, activations\n",
    "2. **Weights** - all learned parameters from training\n",
    "3. **Optimizer state** - Adam optimizer configuration and momentum\n",
    "4. **Compilation settings** - loss function, metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Saving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skip retraining**: Load the model instantly instead of training for 20 epochs\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Use the model in production applications\n",
    "- **Sharing**: Share the trained model with others\n",
    "- **Versioning**: Save different versions as you experiment\n",
    "- **Continued training**: Load and continue training with more data\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Load the Model Later\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the complete model\n",
    "loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('fashion_mnist_model.keras')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it for predictions\n",
    "predict_clothing_image('my_image.jpg', loaded_model, class_names)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Save Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HDF5 format** (legacy): `model.save('model.h5')`\n",
    "- **Weights only**: `model.save_weights('weights.h5')` - saves only weights, not architecture\n",
    "- **SavedModel format**: `model.save('saved_model/')` - for TensorFlow Serving (production)\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend the `.keras` format as it's the modern standard and most convenient."
